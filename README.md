# discover-self

MVP:
As a user I would like to enter in my social media details into the application and have the following analysis become available to me on the webpage in a dashboard-like fashion:

- My top 10 most used words
- My top 10 most talked to people
- My top 3 most liked photos (if it is facebook or instagram)
- Photo that has attracted most comments

Phase 1 stretch goals:

Instead of on the fly rendering turn the app into a login based repository:

- As a user I want to be able to create an account and have access to my self discovery board at any time I like


Phase 2 stretch goals:

Have a customizable board instead of a static board:

- As a user I want to be able to remove an analysis from the dashboard so that I don't clutter my screen with something that doesn't interest me
- As a user I want to be able to add analytics to my dashboard so I can discover myself further
